I work across multiple functions for AI/data projects spanning machine learning, data and cloud engineering, software architecture, technical leadership, people management, and business development in Southeast Asia and beyond.

- Managing and mentoring data/ML engineers and consultants, spearheading initiatives to build AI/ML tools (computer vision, document processing), driving process improvements, and providing technical guidance to my team and the teams we work with.
- Designed and developed complex data ingestion pipelines, RESTful microservices, database architecture, and graph algorithm deduplication infrastructure for a smart search web app to facilitate the aggregation of millions of records to surface key company insights and improve due diligence for investment teams in a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund.
- Leading the technical scoping and strategic exploration of numerous AI/ML project opportunities and proof-of-concepts (POCs) across domains like NLP, computer vision, and generative AI (e.g. LLMs like GPT), with clients in various verticals including logistics, capital-heavy industries, manufacturing, and financial services. Collaborated with engineers, consultants, analysts, marketing, and sales in cross-functional teams to push business development initiatives, develop architecture diagrams and solution proposals, strategize market penetration, and understand client pain points.
- Developed single customer view algorithms and transforms for a Philippine airline company to consolidate numerous customer records from disparate systems.
- Supervised the technical development of multiple AI/ML POCs, including one for preventive maintenance using satellite imagery and computer vision, and another for Thai-language information extraction from financial statements.
- As a people manager, I support and develop the careers of multiple engineers, analysts, and consultants, both junior and senior.
