I work across multiple functions for AI/data projects spanning machine learning, data and cloud engineering, software architecture, technical leadership, people management, and business development in Southeast Asia and beyond.

- As a lead, I am responsible for managing data/ML engineers and consultants, spearheading initiatives to build AI/ML tools (computer vision, document processing), driving process improvements, and providing technical guidance to my team and the teams we work with.
- I develop end-to-end data solutions, design microservice architecture, experiment with deep learning models, and implement machine learning algorithms for key clients to help them leverage their data and gain valuable insights for their organization's operations.
- I scope multiple AI/ML project opportunities and POCs with clients in various fields including logistics and financial services.
