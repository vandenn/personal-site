A fullstack single page application (SPA) web blog implemented in React+Redux (focusing on hooks) with Express and PostgreSQL. This is a sporadically growing project that serves as a sandbox for implementing various libraries and services.

As a teenager, I've longed to build the next big social media site. I would create scrap HTML and CSS code just to make something that resembles a home page. However, since I had very little programming experience then, none of the projects ever came to fruition.

In a way, this project is a small materialization of that dream. Here, I apply or experiment with some of the insights I've gained from coding with various React+Redux, Express, and PostgreSQL libraries in the industry.
