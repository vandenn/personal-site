A fun passion project that I did during my early college years. The game was developed mainly using an AS3 library called Flixel in the FlashDevelop IDE. All the pixel art was also made by me using GIMP and Paint.

This game taught me a lot of things in my early programming years about code organization and object-oriented programming. It was also my first dive into critically thinking about UI/UX and game design.
