A deep learning paper that focuses on the use of social media, specifically Twitter, for determining dengue activity in the Philippines. The paper describes the use of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) based neural network that classifies tweets as being related to one or more dengue centered topics. The results from analyzing these online interactions were then collated and compared against actual epidemiology data which turned out to have a significantly high correlation. **The developed model showed immense potential in being able to quickly assess dengue activity to inform emergency response need.**
