👋 I'm Evan! I'm a **machine learning consultant**, **data engineer**, and **fullstack software developer**. 

📈 In the realm of ML, I specialize in the fields of **natural language processing**, **computer vision**, and **deep learning**, with **research papers published in two Scopus-indexed conferences**.

🔧 On the engineering side of things, I've **led the design and implementation of several robust backend solutions, databases, and microservice architectures** for a couple of major clients. I've worked with a lot of different technologies over the years (and I'm studying more!), but I've spent a lot of my time with **Python, Javascript, and C#**, and I've had experience with a ton of various libraries including PyTorch, TensorFlow+Keras, FastAPI, React+Redux, and more. I also deal with **DevOps, cloud computing, and deployment jobs** involving continuous integration with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Gitlab CI to major cloud platforms including GCP and AWS. In fact, some time back, I also got certified as a **Google Cloud Platform Professional Cloud Architect**!

💼 I've dabbled in **business development**, particularly contributing to scoping machine learning and data platform projects across multiple verticals including logistics, capital-heavy industries, manufacturing, and financial services.

👥 I've also grown quite a lot as a people manager, **supporting and developing the careers of engineers and developers**, both junior and senior.

🎲 Outside of work, I'm also a board game enthusiast (eurogames!), a home cook, a coffee brewing novice, a graphic designer, and a weeb looking to get proficient in Japanese (よろしくお願いします！).
