I'm Evan! I'm a **machine learning consultant**, **researcher**, and **software/data engineer**, and I specialize in the fields of **natural language processing**, **computer vision**, and **deep learning**, with **research papers published in two Scopus-indexed conferences**.

I've worked with a variety of major programming languages including **Python, C#, and Javascript**, and I also have experience with many associated libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow+Keras for AI, C#’s ASP.NET, and the React+Redux stack among many others. I've also worked with DevOps, cloud computing, and deployment jobs involving continuous integration with Docker, Kubernetes, and Gitlab CI to major cloud platforms including GCP and AWS. I am goal-oriented and a quick learner when it comes to studying new technologies.

**Python, C#, and Javascript are my go-to languages**, and I've had experience with a ton of different libraries over the years including PyTorch, TensorFlow+Keras, FastAPI, React+Redux, and more. I've led the **design and implementation of several robust backend solutions, databases, and microservice architectures** for a couple of major clients, also working with **DevOps, cloud computing, and deployment jobs** involving continuous integration with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Gitlab CI to major cloud platforms including GCP and AWS. In fact, some time back, I also got certified as a **Google Cloud Platform Professional Cloud Architect**!

I've dabbled in **business development**, particularly contributing to scoping machine learning and data platform projects across multiple verticals including logistics, capital-heavy industries, manufacturing, and financial services. I've also grown quite a lot as a people manager, **supporting and developing the careers of engineers and developers**, both junior and senior.

Outside of work, I'm also a board game enthusiast (eurogames!), a home cook, a coffee brewing novice, a graphic designer, and a weeb looking to get proficient in Japanese (よろしくお願いします！).
