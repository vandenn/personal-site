I'm Evan! I'm a **machine learning consultant**, **researcher**, and **software/data engineer**, and I specialize in the fields of **natural language processing**, **computer vision**, and **deep learning**. I've published **two machine/deep learning research papers in scopus-indexed conferences**.

I've worked with a variety of major programming languages including **Python, C#, and Javascript**. I also have experience with many associated libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow+Keras for AI, C#’s ASP.NET, and the React+Redux stack among many others. I've also worked with DevOps, cloud computing, and deployment jobs involving continuous integration with Docker, Kubernetes, and Gitlab CI to major cloud platforms including GCP and AWS. I am goal-oriented and a quick learner when it comes to studying new technologies.

Outside of work, I'm also a board game enthusiast (eurogames!), a home cook, a coffee brewing novice, a graphic designer, and someone aspiring to learn Japanese and Mandarin (こんにちは! 你好!).
